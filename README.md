# UFOs Analysis

## Project Overview
UFO sightings data stored in a data file as a JavaScript array was imported and converted to a dynamic table using JavaScript. Displayed in a user-friendly webpage using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, the table is able to be filtered based on key values such as date, city, state, country and shape. 

See full table on webpage here, https://github.com/Ninax3/UFOs/blob/main/Full%20Table%20.png

## Results
To filter the UFO sightings table, enter any or all of the desired search criteria in the provided fields - date, city, state, country and/or shape. The filtered table appears to the right.

## Summary
The UFO Sightings webpage and table prove to be a visually dynamic way to display the data contained in the JavaScript array. The table can easily be updated as data is added to the original JavaScript file. However, the table displayed is limited to the columns established and shown. If a new column were to be added to the data file, JavaScript code will need to be revised to show it on the webpage table.

The following revisions are recommended to enhance the current webpage -  
1. Add a numbered list to the table results and results count per search. 
2. Ability to filter with a drop down selection at the column title. For example, by date. 
3. A "no results" message for when filter criteria returns no results. See current table, with no results returned, here - https://github.com/Ninax3/UFOs/blob/main/No_Results_Filter.png
